		<h4>A recent review in the “Sizzletown Beat” by the famous roving reporter and theater critic Artemis Blue of the new psychobabble musical dramedy “LOST AND FOUND IN SIZZLETOWN”.</h4>
		<h2>Something &nbsp; is &nbsp; Cooking &nbsp; In &nbsp; SIZZLETOWN!</h2>
		<h3>By Artemis Blue</h3>
		<p>You’re probably one of those folks who thinks you have the formula for life all worked out. Yea, as if life is nothing more than a Betty Crocker recipe; I wonder if the old gal knew the recipe for failure? Or the ingredients of success?</p>
		<p>Well, Ed Cupman and Bernie Bolter are the short-order cooks who baked, boiled and fried up one hell of a meal for you; that is, if you’re up for a slice of bittersweet pie! And the makings of this tasty San Francisco tart? The denizens of Frisco’s infamous Sizzletown.</p>
		<p>Take Frankie, the stories narrator and ghostly guiding light: Part Peacock, part Teddy Bear. Think of a slab of banana creme pie and a meat ball sandwich. When they made Frankie, they definitely threw away the recipe.</p>
		<p>And the protagonist of this Sizzletown treat? Frankie’s wayward son, Johnny. Sweet as honey . . . distilled with one part Tabasco sauce and two parts . . . coyote. Johnny is best if kept at arms length.</p>
		<p>Then there’s Mabel: what can I say, she’s like a freshly baked, still warm loaf of Sizzletown sourdough. Is Mabel too good to be true?</p>
		<p>And Mabel’s father, good old Maestro. Every time I think of Maestro I see a steaming bowl of clam . . . chowder-head. A fishing fool if ever there was one.</p>
		<p>And last but not least, Talulah: take a shot from a Bogart film, shake it up, pour it over ice and low and behold, you get Talulah. A dish best served . . . with scam and eggs.</p>
		<p>Toss it all together and what you get is the song and dance yarn of a boy, who spent his formidable years growing up with a dear of a mother . . . a steadfast rock of Gibraltar . . . who actually . . . was his FATHER, the renowned star of Enrico Faccacio’s infamous nightclub: the sordid, seamy and dare I say, seedy lair in the lonely-heart center of San Francisco’s notorious . . . Sizzletown.</p>
		<p>Where coming of age was more about survival of the . . . slickest, than about being able to tell the difference between fantasy and . . . well . . . fantasy? Where image and reflection don’t always tell the truth. Where what you see in the mirror may not actually be . . . what you see in the mirror.</p>
		<p>This is the foolhardy tale and poignant account of Johnny Midnight . . . Who was “LOST AND FOUND IN SIZZLETOWN”.</p>
